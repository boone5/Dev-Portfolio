# Development Portfolio
### Hello ! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Below are some personal projects I pursue in my freetime.

## Dessert Explorer
Dessert Explorer is a simple app I built to show desserts and their respective details. This app utilizes TheMealDB API where I hit certain endpoints to retrieve information about desserts and their details. To gain some experience with cacheing, I implemented an Image Cache with the URLs received back from the API. I also wrote some Unit Tests to ensure my network layer is working as expected.
