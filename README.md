### Hello ! 🙋‍♂️ Below are some personal projects I pursue in my freetime.

## Dessert Explorer

#### Status: _Completed_

Dessert Explorer is a simple app I built to show desserts and their respective details. This app utilizes TheMealDB API where I hit certain endpoints to retrieve information about desserts and their details. To gain some experience with cacheing, I implemented an Image Cache with the URLs received back from the API. I also wrote some Unit Tests to ensure my network layer is working as expected.

For this project I chose to target iOS 15 and develop in Xcode 14.3.1. There's room for improvement here, but it was a fun project to get my feet wet with more technologies and a complicated API.
