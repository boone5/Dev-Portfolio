# Development Portfolio
### Hello ! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Below are some personal projects I pursue in my freetime.

## Dessert Explorer

#### Status: _Completed_

Dessert Explorer is a simple app I built to show desserts and their respective details. This app utilizes TheMealDB API where I hit certain endpoints to retrieve information about desserts and their details. To gain some experience with cacheing, I implemented an Image Cache with the URLs received back from the API. I also wrote some Unit Tests to ensure my network layer is working as expected.

For this project I chose to target iOS 15 and develop in Xcode 14.3.1. There's room for improvement here, but it was a fun project to get my feet wet with more technologies and a complicated API.

## Rocket League App

#### Status: _Abandoned_

This is an app based off one of my favorite games (Rocket League) that I actually got pretty good at and played at a semi-professional level in college! üöÄ

I approached this as a passion project and built out a surface level app with mocked data from the designs I created in Figma. Unfortnuately, it turned into a lot of hoops to jump through to gain API access to their data so I haulted development üòû Was fun to build out and design nonetheless!
