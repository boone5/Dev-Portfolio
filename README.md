<!--## Rocket League App

#### Status: _Abandoned_ üò≥

This is an app based off one of my favorite games (Rocket League) that I actually got pretty good at and played at a semi-professional level in college! üöÄ

I approached this as a passion project and built out a surface level app with mocked data from the designs I created in Figma. Unfortnuately, it turned into a lot of hoops to jump through to gain API access to their data so I haulted development üòû One new technology I got experience with was Xcodegen and YML to help with building my project between multiple branches. Was fun to build out and design while it lasted!
